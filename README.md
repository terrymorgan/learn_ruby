Test First Ruby -- RSpec 3 Edition
==========
This is a twice-forked version of test-first.org's [learn_ruby](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby#install) project.

[The OdinProject](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/learn_ruby) forked these exercises from [https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby](https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby) and updated them to use RSpec 3 instead of RSpec 2.

I forked these from [The OdinProject](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/learn_ruby) and completed the exercises.

##Completed
This set of exercises teaches how to do test driven development from pre-existing tests and also how to write tests.  My program code and rspec code is viewable in this repo.
